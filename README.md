# About

actually i have no idea why i write this code.

and then at 231103, i have a need to check test rust code build for a mt7621a based SOHO router (RedMi AC2100),
I found this code in my PC.

After I build the OpenWRT toolchain for the mt7621a target, I use this code to build a binary (<2MBytes) and
upload it to the router, and it works! (RSS is <2MBytes).

So I upload this code to serve as a reference to how to build a mipsel binary.
